Experiments for section 4

- We can explore 3 uncertainty classes in the bsn through formulae variables: costs, reliabilities, frequencies and sensors availability. With it, we want to make sure that we explore scenarios where we present the controlled system behavior with one or more untamed uncertainties and with all uncertainties tamed. Thus, evidencing that our approach guides the development of controllers capable of taming uncertainties in runtime.

- Our experimentation scenarios are:

   1) approach untamed uncertainties
        1.1) untamed environmental sources
                1.1.1) uncertain available sensors @ runtime 
                1.1.2) uncertainty regarding the presence of the moving average filter 
        1.2) untamed system goals sources
                1.2.1) uncertainty regarding the sensors sampling rate configuration  (in progress..)
                              -- may harm patients with specific usage profile (e.g. cardiac)
       1.3) untamed system itself sources
                1.3.1) uncertain centralhub reliability 
                              -- may be due to exceeding patients (messaging queue overflow)
       1.4) untamed sources salad
                1.4.1) mix all three sources above 

   2) approach tamed uncertainties
        2.1) no uncertainties with respect to the modeled ones (done)

- policies:
     adaptation goals:
          cost setpoint = 0.47 w +- 2%;
          reliability setpoint =  90% +- 2%;
     actions (knobs): 
          change sensors sampling rate
          change centralhub frequency
   
- 5 minutes execution
